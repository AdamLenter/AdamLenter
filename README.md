## About Me

Hi. My name is Adam Lenter. Welcome to my GitHub repoitory.

When I was 6 years old, my parents bought an Apple ]\[ computer for me and my brother. I soon learned how to create programs in the Basic programming language. My first program looked something like this:

It wasn't much, but I knew the possibilities were endless. From there, I made text based adventure games, a simple drawing program, and lots of silly little programs.

Years later, the Internet was born and a whole new world opened up. Sometime around 1995, a my dorm neighbor taught me the basics of HTML. Our college gave students free webspace, so I created a personal homepage. Thanks to the Wayback Machine, you can see still see it in all its glory (No - I will NOT share a link):

My career took me in a different direction - toward the nonprofit education sector - but I continued to dabble for years with databases and basic websites. Over time, I discovered that small nonprofit organizations did not have the tools they needed to operate efficiently, measure success, or plan strategically for the future. And I wanted to do something about that. So I taught myself how to develop web applications and started my own business, Vision Advance Solutions. 

I subsequently developed a donor management/online registration system called DonorAdvance, an afterschool program management system called ProgramAdvance, and other CRM systems for mission driven organizations.

I recently decided to take my programming skills to the next level. So I attended the Flatiron School where I earned a Certificate in Full Stack Engineering.

My public GitHub repository contains some of the projects I developed at the Flatiron School as well as some of the projects I've worked on since graduatng. You can see video demonstrations of my projects here: https://www.youtube.com/@LenterProjectDemos.
